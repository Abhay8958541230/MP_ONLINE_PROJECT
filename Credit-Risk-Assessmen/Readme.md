# 💳 AI-Based Credit Risk Assessment System

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Based Credit Risk Assessment System is a Machine Learning application developed to estimate the credit risk of loan applicants. The system analyzes applicant information such as income, loan amount, employment status, education, credit history, and property area to classify applicants as **Low Credit Risk** or **High Credit Risk**.

The project uses the **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction and provides an interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**.
